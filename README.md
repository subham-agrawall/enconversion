# enconversion
A system to convert English sentences into expressions of an interlingua called Universal Networking Language (UNL). UNL represents knowledge in form of semantic network, where nodes represent concepts and links represent semantic roles between concepts. UNL nodes also contain semantic attributes like number, tense, aspect, mood, negation etc. 

Example: John worked specially for the social fund.

[UNL representation] agt(work.@past.@entry, John), man(work.@past.@entry, specially), pur(work.@past.@entry, fund), mod(fund, social)

Here agt (agent), man (manner of the action), pur (purpose) and mod (modifier) are the UNL relations.
